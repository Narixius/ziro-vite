\section{Abstract}

Ziro is a modern JavaScript framework designed to simplify web development by offering a flexible and scalable foundation. With inspiration from frameworks like Remix, Next.js, Nuxt, and Astro, Ziro prioritizes typesafety, modular design, and an improved developer experience. It provides tools to streamline workflows and address common development challenges.

Core features of Ziro include support for 3 different rendering, server-side rendering (SSR), client-side rendering, and a partially SSR mode that streams data to users in real time using web streams. Developers can utilize middlewares, actions, loaders, and meta tag management to build dynamic applications. These features are complemented by a modular architecture, and the ability to extend functionality using pre-created plugins, ensuring reusability across projects.

This project acts as a proof of concept, demonstrating that full-stack JavaScript applications can be integrated with plugins to accelerate development and scale more effectively. By balancing simplicity and adaptability, Ziro aims to empower developers to build reliable and extensible web applications that grow with their needs while integrating seamlessly with existing technologies.
